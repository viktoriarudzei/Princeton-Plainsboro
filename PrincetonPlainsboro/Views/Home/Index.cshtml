        <h2>Welcome to Princeton Plainsboro</h2>
        <p>
            Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (or PPTH) is the fictitious teaching hospital where House is set.
            It is located in Princeton, New Jersey on Prospect Street (as seen on Chase's GPS when he rushes to the hospital in After Hours)
            The hospital presumably is located near the neighboring township of Plainsboro. Princeton University's Frist Campus Center is used in the aerial screen shots.
            It was apparently based on a hospital near where series co-creator Bryan Singer grew up.

        <h3>About our Doctors</h3>
        <p> Doctor Lisa Cuddy was the Hospital's Dean of Medicine and head administrator. She is responsible for all the day-to-day functions of the hospital, including supervising the department heads, overseeing medical training, disciplining students, making personnel decisions about non-tenured staff, determining who may have hospital privileges, and meeting the hospital's ongoing regulatory requirements. She reports directly to the Board but she later resigned after her former boyfriend, Gregory House crashed his car into her living-room. 
            House's former fellow, Dr. Eric Foreman has since replaced Cuddy and continues overseeing the day-to-day running of the hospital.
            <p>Each department of the hospital has a department head, who is responsible for personnel decisions within the department and ensuring interns, residents and fellows are properly supervised during their medical training.
            Princeton-Plainsboro's Head Nurse is Brenda Previn who is responsible for allocation of patient rooms and diagnostic facilities.</p>
